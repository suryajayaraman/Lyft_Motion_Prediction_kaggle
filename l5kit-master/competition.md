# Competition

Starting 24.08.2020 we are hosting a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lyft-motion-prediction-autonomous-vehicles/overview) about predicting future movements of other traffic participants.
This page serves as introduction point for it and gives additional information.

# Scoring
When taking part in the competition, you will be asked to submit predictions for a private test set (no ground truth is available),
and your solutions will be scored by Kaggle. Overall 30.000 USD as prizes are available!
As traffic scenes can contain a large amount of ambiguity and uncertainty, we encourage the submission of multi-modal predictions.
For scoring, we calculate the *negative log-likelihood* of the ground truth data given these multi-modal predictions.
Let us take a closer look at this.
Assume, ground truth positions of a sample trajectory are

and we predict K hypotheses, represented by means

In addition, we predict confidences c of these K hypotheses.
We assume the ground truth positions to be modelled by a mixture of multi-dimensional independent Normal distributions over time,
yielding the likelihood

You can find our implementation [here](https://github.com/lyft/l5kit/blob/20ab033c01610d711c3d36e1963ecec86e8b85b6/l5kit/l5kit/evaluation/metrics.py#L4), which uses *error* as placeholder for the exponent

and for numeral stability further applies the [log-sum-exp trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogSumExp#log-sum-exp_trick_for_log-domain_calculations):
Assume, we need to calculate the logarithm of a sum of exponentials:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Clarge%20LSE%28x_1%2C%20%5Cldots%2C%20x_n%29%20%3D%20%5Clog%28e%5E%7Bx_1%7D%20&plus;%20%5Cldots%20&plus;%20e%5E%7Bx_n%7D%29)

Then, we rewrite this by substracting the maximum value x<sup>*</sup> from each exponent, resulting in much increased numerical stability:

# Additional Metrics
Scoring multi-modal prediction models is a highly complex task, and while we chose the metric described above due to its elegance and support for multi-modality,
we encourage participants to also employ other metrics for assessing their models.
Examples of such other metrics, commonly used in literature, are *Average Displacement Error* (ADE) and *Final Displacement Error* (FDE) (see 
[our dataset paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14480.pdf) or [SophieGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01482.pdf)):
ADE is the average displacement error (L2 distance between prediction and ground truth averaged over all timesteps), while FDE 
reports the final displacement error (L2 distance between prediction and ground truth, evaluated only at the last timestep).
As we consider multiple predictions, we offer [implementations for both these metrics](https://github.com/lyft/l5kit/blob/os/add_competition_documentation/l5kit/l5kit/evaluation/metrics.py) either averaging over all hypotheses 
or using the best hypothesis (oracle variant) - ignoring generated confidence scores in both cases.
